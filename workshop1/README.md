# Workshop 1
Welcome to the first part of the Advanced Programming course workshop! In this part, we will be building a vehicle catalog application for a vehicle constructor company.

In this phase, we will be focusing on creating the basic structure of the application, including the classes and methods needed to manage a catalog of vehicles. We will be defining the properties and behaviors of each vehicle type
We will also be creating a class diagram to illustrate the relationships between the classes, and defining the state transitions for each object in the application.
