Welcome to the Advanced Programming course workshop! In this workshop, we will be diving deep into object-oriented programming concepts, design patterns, and best practices for building scalable and maintainable applications.

Over the course of this workshop, we will be building a vehicle catalog application for a vehicle constructor company. We will start by creating the basic structure of the application, including the classes and methods needed to manage a catalog of vehicles. We will then refine the user experience and add new features to the application, such as user authentication, activity and sequence diagrams, and state diagrams for each object that can change state.

Throughout the workshop, we will be using a variety of tools and techniques to design, implement, and test our application. We will be using Python for the implementation and UML diagrams for the desing of the application
