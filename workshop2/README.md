# Workshop 2

Welcome to the second part of the Advanced Programming course workshop! In this part, we will be refining and expanding upon the vehicle catalog application that we built in the first part.

In this phase, we will be focusing on improving the user experience and adding new features to the application. We will be creating a user authentication system, refining the user stories, and creating activity and sequence diagrams to better understand the processes and interactions within the application.

We will also be creating CRC cards to identify the classes and their responsibilities, and updating the class diagram to reflect the new features and changes. Additionally, we will be creating state diagrams for each object that can change state in the application.
